# iqr_based_filtering

Hello
To clean the data and remove outliers data, one of the methods is to use iqr, and no matter what I searched, I did not find a ready-to-use method.
That's why I implemented this code.
instructions:
Run the code, send the Excel file address.
Enter the columns that need to be checked (one by one) and select done.
In the same folder where the Excel file is located, a file with the same name and with the suffix _edit has been created, where the clean data is stored.
notice: 
saveing files in csv format.  
(with a small change, all format can be uploaded, but it requires more work.)
